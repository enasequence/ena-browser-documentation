25/03/2025 - Checklist updates
=============================

*What has changed?*

The ENA has implemented some improvements to our underlying sample checklist systems.

*When did it change?*

These improvements were integrated into our TEST endpoints and interfaces in December 2024.
As 24th March 2025, these improvements have been integrated into our production services.

*How will it affect me?*

Users should not see any effect on validation, however the validation messages that appear to users appear differently. This is due to the old system running on XML schema based validation, while the new system validates using JSON schema.

A detailed table of how these error messages have changed can be found here: https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/samples/sample_checklist/sample_checklist_errors.html

Should you experience any difficulties please raise a support request here: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/support
