Cross Reference Search
======================

Introduction
============

The ENA Xref service holds cross-references to a number of external data resources 
linked to ENA records.

These cross-reference sources include both services operated by colleagues at EMBL-EBI 
(such as `UniProt <http://www.uniprot.org/>`_ and `Ensembl <http://www.ensembl.org/>`_) 
as well as those operated outside EMBL-EBI (including `SILVA <http://www.arb-silva.de/>`_ 
and `RFAM <http://rfam.xfam.org/>`_).

The update and frequency of each source is dependent on their own release cycle and/or 
internal processes, with ENA supporting updates as frequently as once a week.

These cross-references can also be explored programmatically using the 
`x-ref API <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/xref/rest/>`_.

If you would be interested in registering your resource as part of our cross-reference 
service, you can request to be added as a new Xref source 
`here <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UHGQRHXoIbEL1nNaTt1dYzVGwY1v6BIlcPWQ03S5j9U>`_ 
and a member of the team will get into contact with you to discuss your eligibility.

Xref Sources
============

A cross-reference source is the external data source that has been registered as a 
cross-reference within ENA. For more information on the available cross-reference sources, 
see the Source Details tab.

Xref Targets
============

A cross-reference target is the ENA data type which the external cross-reference is associated 
with. Current ENA targets:

- analysis
- assembly
- coding
- experiment
- noncoding
- run
- sample
- sequence 
- study
- taxon
- trace
- wgsmaster

Search for Xrefs by source
==========================

Select an Xref source to begin your search. You can narrow down your search further by 
specifying the target data type or acccession. 

In some cases, the external data source will have provided further useful information, 
you can choose to display this additional information by selecting the 'Expanded' view.

Search for Xrefs by ENA record
==============================

Return all cross-references associated with an ENA record by searching using the INSDC 
accession.
