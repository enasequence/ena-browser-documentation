Sequence Similarity Search
==========================

Introduction
============

Submit a nucleotide sequence and receive a summary of all public INSDC assembled and annotated 
sequence records with regions of sequence similarity. Search using default parameters or optionally 
tailor your search further using the 'Search against' and 'Set parameters' options.

This service is backed by `NCBI BLAST+ <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/sss/ncbiblast/>`_
and you will be redirected to the NCBI BLAST+ service once the job is submitted. Please refer to the 
`help & documentation <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=94147939>`_ 
for usage details and parameter options.

Search against a specific sequence set
======================================

Select a specific sequence set to refine your search to a specific sequence data type.

If you wish to limit your search by taxonomic group or sequence data class this will restrict the 
search to the latest ENA release only.

Set parameters for your search
==============================

Searches can be performed using blastn, tblastx or tblastn. Please refer to the 
`help & documentation <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=94147939>`_ 
for usage details and parameter options.
